## Overview

`system-deploy` started as my personal server configuration and management tool. It's heavily inspired by systemd's unit files and is focused on
simplicity and ease of use. Thanks to the <img src="https://golang.org/lib/godoc/images/go-logo-blue.svg" alt="Go" width="30"> programming
language, the released binary is statically linked and does not require any external dependencies like heavy execution environments or
preinstalled packages.

#### Features

* systemd unit file syntax
* static binary without external dependencies
* detect changes and trigger actions
* multi-platform supported
* extensible and hackable

## Getting started

This section will give you a quick overview on how to work with system-deploy so you can jumpstart your server configuration.
For more information on system-deploy, examples and more documentation please checkout the sections on the left.

### Installation

To install *system-deploy*, just download the latest release binary for your platform from the release page and copy it to
a location inside your `$PATH`. 

[Release Page](https://github.com/khulnasoft-lab/system-deploy/releases){: .btn .btn-green .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2}

For example, to install `system-deploy` to `/usr/local/bin`, use the following:

```bash
VERSION=0.1.0
DOWNLOAD_LINK=https://github.com/khulnasoft-lab/system-deploy/releases/download/v${VERSION}/system-deploy_${VERSION}_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
              
# Download and unpack the archive
wget -O system-deploy.tar.gz ${DOWNLOAD_LINK}
tar xfz ./system-deploy.tar.gz

# Add execution permissions and copy to /usr/local/bin
chmod a+x ./system-deploy
sudo mv ./system-deploy /usr/local/bin 
```

Finally, try running system-deploy:

```bash
system-deploy help
```

### Create your first task

Now, let's create your first system-deploy task by creating the directory `~/.deploy/` and a task file:

~/.deploy/10-install-tools.task
{: .code-example .fw-300 }

```ini
[Task]
Description=Install various tools

[InstallPackages]
# AptPkgs will only be installed if `apt` is
# available (i.e. on Debia, Ubuntu and friends)
AptPkgs=vim git golang zsh restic ssmtp htop acl
AptPkgs=tree unattended-upgrades

# PacmanPkgs will onyl be installed if `pacman`
# is available (i.e. on Arch Linux, Manjaro, ...)
PacmanPkgs=vim go git acl zsh restic htop tree msmtp
```

Finally, execute all tasks in `~/.deploy`:

```bash
$ system-deploy ~/.deploy
INFO[0004] 10-install-tools.task         : updated 
```

Congrats, you just created your first deployment task! Time to read on:
